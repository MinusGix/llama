# llama

A friendly LLVM library for Rust.

Goals:
- Support the latest `llvm-sys` release
- Provide a nice interface, while still remaining as close as possible to the LLVM C API.

**NOTE**: `llama` will let you generate invalid IR, take a look at [inkwell](https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell) for LLVM bindings with a focus on type-safety
